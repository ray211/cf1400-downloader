## üìÑ What is a CF 1400 File?

The **CF 1400** (U.S. Customs Form 1400) is a document used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to record information about **vessels entering U.S. ports in foreign trade**.

These PDF files contain vessel names, ports of arrival, dates of entrance, and other shipping metadata. They're important for:
- Maritime trade compliance and oversight
- Port traffic and logistics analytics
- Historical tracking of international shipping activity

CBP publishes these forms monthly or quarterly in PDF format.
